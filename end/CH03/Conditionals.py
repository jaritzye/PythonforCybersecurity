# Suggestion - 
#   add in <, ==, > one at a time
#   make each of them if statements initially
#   Change x and y values to test the various paths
#   eventually simplfy with if, elif, else

#Import necessary Python Modules

import platform
import os


#Ask if user is having a good day
def ask_question():
    answer: input("Is today a good day? (y/n)  ")

    # First condition test, answer is 'y'
    if answer == 'y':
        print("Yes it is")
    # Another conditional test, x is equal to y
